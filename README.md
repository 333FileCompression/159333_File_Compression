# File Compression and Decompression with File Corpus
The project is about file compression. There is a file corpus can help researchers to evaluate lossless compression methods which is the Canterbury corpus. It includes test files and compression test results for many research compression methods. The project needs to implement the algorithm of Huffman Coding to compress and decompress the file in corpus. At the same time, the project has to measure compression ratio and speed compared to existing implementations such as zip, gzip, rar etc.


Language: C++

Algorithm: Huffman Coding

In the project, the programmer can measure the compression ratio and runtime using the Canterbury corpus or others.
